# Deep-Learning-from-Scratch
An attempt to recreate the famous library keras from scratch, using the numeric python library numpy. This
framework has been created for educational purposes only.

This package is originally started as part of a project for the Numeric Algorithms course at the 
Polytechnic University of Madrid (Spain). However, we may extend the project to include more features and 
improvements in the future. The main purpose of this project is to learn more about deep learning.

## Installation
We plan to upload the package to PyPI in the near future. 

### Install dependencies
You can do thi easily thanks to the requirements.txt file by just running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Python version
Everything is written in Python 3.7 (to be compatible with Google Colab).

## Dependencies
We use the following libraries:
* **numpy**: for numerical computation
* **tqdm**: for progress bars
* **patchify**: for patching images

## Usage
The usage is very similar to the keras library. See the folder 
[examples](https://github.com/Pabloo22/Deep-Learning-from-Scratch/tree/main/examples) for some examples.
